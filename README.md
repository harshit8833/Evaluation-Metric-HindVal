New Text Generation Evaluation Metric - HindVal

This GitHub repo includes the codes and datafiles used for the project.
The NN.ipynb has different models tried, and how to handle different data sets.

The UI folder contains the code to generate the UI for the final presentation. We need to save the various models to be implemented in a seperate file, along with the pre-processing files for the data.
